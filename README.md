# SpiderWeblang
Creating an alternative to current web technologies

A project intended for youth research in germany but never completed due to its shear size of development.

# Intention
A new language to replace frontend languages HTML, CSS and JS. It should be simple, able to create a site with only a few lines and yet only need small bandwitdh and cpu performance while enabling complex software which can be downloaded as browser apps.

The designing of websites would be similar to android studio as well with their GUI builder.
